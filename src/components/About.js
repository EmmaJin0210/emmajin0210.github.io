            About Me
          </h2>

          <p className="pb-5">
            Hi, this is Emma! Thank you for visiting my website.<br></br>
            I am a current student at the University of Pennsylvania <br></br>
            and an aspiring Software Engineer.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-5">
            My background is in backend and fullstack development for<br></br>
            large-scale systems and cloud enterprise applications, with<br></br>
            experience in scalable data processing, cloud integrations,<br></br>
            and performance optimization. In my past internships, I worked<br></br>
            on high-scale data pipelines, query optimization, and<br></br>
            cloud-based enterprise solutions.<br></br>
          </p>
          <p className="pb-5">
            After entering grad school, I became increasingly interested<br></br>
            in applied AI/ML and NLP, leading me to focus on research<br></br>
            and projects in this area. I also developed a strong interest<br></br>
            in distributed systems, working on projects involving fault<br></br>
            tolerance, scalability, and reliable data transmission. Iâ€™m<br></br>
            excited about opportunities in applied AI/ML, backend engineering,<br></br>
            and scalable cloud applications.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-5">
            In my free time, aside from building projects, I enjoy<br></br>
            distance running, figure skating, and taiko (Japanese drumming)!<br></br>
          </p>
          <p className="pb-5">
